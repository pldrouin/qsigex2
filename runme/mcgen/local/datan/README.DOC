2. COMPILER
   ========

   During installation you have chosen source programs and libraries
   which will work with the compiler(s) "gcc" and "g77".


3. OPERATING SYSTEM
   ================

   During installation you have chosen a Graphics Library which will
   work with the compiler chosen (Section 2) under the operating system
        Linux version 2.0.32
   The executables provided are in ELF format.


4. SETTING OF SEARCH PATH
   ======================

   The batch file to compile and link C and FORTRAN programs have been
   put to /usr/local/bin which should be in the executable search path.
   (For libraries see Sect. 6 below.)


5. THE DIRECTORY /usr/local/datan AND ITS SUBDIRECTORIES
   =====================================================

   The directory /usr/local/datan contains
   - the file README.DOC which you are reading at present,
   - the graphics initialization file GRINIT.DAT,
   - the subdirectories mentioned below.

   The subdirectory /usr/local/datan/datsrc contains
   - the source files of the data analysis programs.

   The subdirectory /usr/local/datan/exasrc contains
   - the source files of the example programs,
   - an executable file for each example program
     which can be directly run as demonstration.

   The subdirectory /usr/local/datan/solsrc contains
   - the source files of programs
     which are solutions to the programming problems,
   - an executable file for each solution program
     which can be directly run as demonstration.

   The subdirectory /usr/local/datan/utils contains
   - files helping with compilation and linking (cf. Sect. 9 below).


6. FILES PUT INTO THE DIRECTORY /usr/local/lib
   ===========================================

   The subdirectory /usr/local/lib contains
   - the static Data Analysis Library libdatsrc.a
     (it is a library file in which all object programs which are produced by
     compiling the source programs in the subdirectory /usr/local/datan/datsrc
     are combined),
   - the static Graphics Library libgrsrc.a
     (a library file containing the graphics programs),
   - the shared library libdatan.so.1.0
     which is a dynamic library loaded at run time and the corresponding
     symbolic links libdatan.so and libdatan.so.1. In order to use this
     library either make sure that the entry /usr/local/lib
     appears in the file /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.in, in which
     case one should run ldconfig after modification of the file (see also
     the man page), or move (copy) the files libdatan.so* to a directory
     mentioned in the file(s) ld.so.conf or set the environment variable
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately.


7. RUNNING A DEMONSTRATION
   =======================

   You may run demonstration programs by running an executable from the
   directories /usr/local/datan/exasrc or /usr/local/datan/solsrc.
   These programs are explained in the text book.


8. MODIFYING THE DATA ANALYSIS LIBRARY
   ===================================

   If you want to change programs from the Data Analysis Library for
   whatever reasons you first have to change the source programs in the
   subdirectory /usr/local/datan/datsrc. Remember that the default libraries
   were created from the C sources. Then you have to compile the modified
   source programs. To ensure that the changed programs are used in your
   application you must give the names of the resulting object files during
   linking, cf. Sect. 9 below, or include the new object files into the
   library so that they replace the original ones. To replace single files
   in the library use ar -rv ... (see man page). It may be simpler for you
   to generate a completely new Data Analysis Library after having changed
   one or several files from the subdirectory /usr/local/datan/datsrc.

   8a COMPILATION AND LIBRARY BUILDING WITH SHELL SCRIPTS
      ---------------------------------------------------

   You should put the source file(s) which are changed or the whole set
   into a directory of your choice. To rebuild the data analysis library
   from C sources run
   /usr/local/datan/utils/makedlib.sh
   If FORTRAN files serve as sources the command is
   /usr/local/datan/utils/makedlibf.sh
   These files rebuild libdatsrc.a as well as the shared library
   (libdatan.so.1.1) by using extracted objects from libgrsrc.a.
   
   8b COMBINED COMPILATION AND LIBRARY BUILDING
      -----------------------------------------

   Type the command
   make -f /usr/local/datan/utils/makefile.lib
   using C sources or
   make -f /usr/local/datan/utils/makefilef.lib
   using FORTRAN sources.
   (The MAKE program will work through the statements contained in the
   description file and the result will be the recompilation of all
   source programs in the current directory and remaining ones in
   /usr/local/datan/datsrc and the creation of a new Data Analysis Library.)

9. COMPILING, LINKING, AND EXECUTING PROGRAMS
   ==========================================

   After the installation has successfully been completed you
   can write any program, compile it, link it with the Data Analysis Library
   and - if needed - with the Graphics Library, and finally execute it. We
   demonstrate here compiling, linking and execution of two example programs.

   9a CREATING YOUR OWN WORKING DIRECTORY
      -----------------------------------
   For every problem you are working on you may create a separate
   subdirectory. For all examples you might, for instance, create
   the directory examples and for the two examples of this section
   the subdirectories examples/ex1 and examples/ex2.
   This is done under Linux by the commands
   mkdir examples
   mkdir examples/ex1
   mkdir examples/ex2
   Now choose the subdirectory examples/ex1 as your working directory
   and copy the source file of the Example Program e2lsq  from the
   subdirectory /usr/local/datan/exasrc into your working directory.
   If you want to use the MAKE facility (Section 9d) copy the file
   makefile.exe from the directory /usr/local/datan/utils to your
   working directory under the name makefile.

   9b COMPILATION
      -----------

   To compile the program e2lsq (if it is written in C) type the command
   dacomp e2lsq
   or (if it is written in FORTRAN)
   fdacomp e2lsq
   (The batch files (f)dacomp located in the directory /usr/local/bin are
   used to initiate the compilation. In the above example they take the
   argument e2lsq and compile e2lsq.c or e2lsq.f, respectively.)

   9c LINKING
      -------

   To link the object file resulting from the compilation of the
   program e2lsq to the Data Analysis Library and to the Graphics
   Library type the command
   dalink e2lsq
   or
   fdalink e2lsq
   (The batch files (f)dalink which is located in the directory
   /usr/local/bin are used to initiate the linking process. In the
   above example they take the argument e2lsq. They can take a list of
   arguments, i.e., initiate the linking of more than one object file
   with the libraries to yield an executable program.)

   9d COMBINED COMPILATION AND LINKING
      --------------------------------

   For compiling a C source file you can type
   make -f /usr/local/datan/utils/makefile.exe e2lsq
   and for a FORTRAN source
   make -f /usr/local/datan/utils/makefilef.exe e2lsq
   If you copy one of these MAKE description files to the current (working)
   directory and give it the name makefile or Makefile you can simply run
   make e2lsq
   (The MAKE description file in the directory then successively
   initiates compilation and linking. It takes only one argument.
   For projects requiring the compilation of more than one file
   the MAKEFILE has to be adapted to the particular project. In that case
   study the MAKE facility (man make).)

   9e EXECUTION
      ---------

   As a result of compilation and linking a file with the name e2lsq
   containing the executable program now exists in your working directory.
   You can execute it by simply entering
   e2lsq


   NOTE
   ----

   The program e2lsq used as example above does not use graphics.
   During execution alphanumeric text is displayed on the screen.
   Its meaning is explained in the text book.

   As a simple example of a main program with graphics you may take e1gr.
   Use examples/ex2 as working directory. Copy the source program e1gr.[cf]
   into it and repeat all steps of this section (replacing e2lsq by e1gr).


10. ACTION IN CASE OF DIFFICULTIES
    ==============================

   10a ERRORS WITH COMPILATION, LINKING OR LIBRARY BUILDING
       ----------------------------------------------------
   Please check:
   - whether the particular compiler which you selected during
     installation is available on your computer,
   - whether your version of the compiler is invoked
     with exactly those keywords used in the files
     /usr/local/bin/(f)dacomp and /usr/local/bin/(f)dalink or in
     the file /usr/local/datan/utils/makefile(f).exe
     or in the case of library building in the file
     /usr/local/datan/utils/makedlib(f).sh or in the file
     /usr/local/datan/utils/makefile(f).lib,
   - whether the compiler environment is set up properly, in particular
     whether the search path conventions of Section 11 are fulfilled.
   You may possibly have to install the compiler, repeat the installation
   (cf. Section 5 above) or change the batch files mentioned above.

   10b ERRORS WITH THE GRAPHICS
       ------------------------

   Please check:
   - whether the file GRERR.LIS contains explicit error messages,
   - whether your computer really has the type of graphics workstation
     you selected,
   - whether the graphics initialization file GRINIT.DAT exists and
     whether it describes correctly the graphics workstation you selected.
     Note: The file GRINIT.DAT is first searched for in you working directory.
     If not found there it is searched for in the directory /usr/local/datan.
   If necessary, you must select a different workstation and/or change the
   contents of the file GRINIT.DAT.


11. PATH NAMES OF COMPILERS AND THEIR LIBRARIES
    ===========================================

   The files makedlib(f).sh, (f)dacomp and (f)dalink and the
   files of type MAKEFILE contain references to your compiler, its
   library manager and linker, and to the compiler libraries.
   These programs and libraries are located in directories with names that were
   defined during the installation of the compiler on your computer. Most
   probably, these names are identical to the default names suggested by the
   producers of your compiler and used by us. It is possible, however, that the
   directory names are different from the defaults. The commands to
   invoke the compiler, library manager, and linker in the batch files
   mentioned above are independent of the name of the directory in which they
   are found. It is required, however, that the name of that directory be
   entered into the search path using the environment variable PATH. Please
   make sure that the directory name of your compiler is mentioned in the
   variable PATH, which is set in your login profile.

   The compiler libraries may be referred to by their absolute path names in
   the batch file (f)dalink, i.e., the explicit directory names are used.
   If different path names are used on your computer, you have to
   change the batch file.


12. ADDITIONAL REMARKS FOR GRAPHICS UNDER X11
    =========================================

   The graphics information (for redrawing and zoom) is stored in a
   temporary file XW.<UID_hex>_<PID_hex> under the directory /tmp (see
   below). If this file system is full the graphics redrawing may fail.
   Normally the temporary file is deleted when the program finishes.
   In the case of a program abort or closing of the graphics window not
   by giving ENTER with the mouse cursor in the window but by using the
   window manager the temporary file will remain on the file system.
   Therefore, from time to time the directory should be inspected for
   old files.

   The graphics window is sensitive to the key strokes "r" and "s" in
   addition to the ENTER key. The first one (set remove status) prevents
   the program from saving the graphics (caution) so that this window
   closes after the program is finished. The second one (set save status)
   restores "normal" behavior if the current plot is not yet finished or
   for a possible next plot.

   The default behavior and look can be changed by adding entries to
   $HOME/.Xdefaults or to an equivalent place. The graphics package
   reads the entries for:

   - X11 geometry specification in standard form, e.g.,
   datan.Geometry: =848x600-0-0

   - directory where to save the temporary files (see above), e.g.,
   datan.SaveDirectory: /var/tmp

   - colors of the mouse pointer, e.g.,
   datan.MouseColor: Blue
   datan.MouseMask: Red

   - title of the graphics window, e.g.,
   datan.IconText: DATAN 2.1

   - the status for saving the plots (see above, 0: remove, 1: save),
   datan.SaveStatus: 1
